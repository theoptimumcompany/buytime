An hospitality service platform design is now open source!


After the closure of our startup, we decided to publish all material produced under the Apache 2.0 license.

So you can use this source code respecting the Apache 2.0 license.

We hope this project may be an inspiration and that the idea one day will be on the market improving the hospitality sector how we envisioned it.

The design is Open Source as well on Figma:

## Getting Started

The application is built with Flutter
[https://flutter.dev/docs](https://flutter.dev/docs)

The backend relies on a Firebase project, so you will have to connect the firebase project you want to use with the flutter application
[https://firebase.google.com/](https://firebase.google.com/)
The firebase project has to run on a blaze plan (paid) because of the usage of Cloud functions and plugins.

We built our payment system around Stripe and Paypal

The explaination on how to successfully run all features is out of scope, but if you have questions or you open issues we are happy to answer!
